## List your technical/design/product background and achievements at a CUI Level. What topics, if any, are you most excited to work on at the hackathon?

Extended functionality of Google Forms and Sheets with Google AppScripts and Rscripts to create double blind reviews and rankings of proposals for professional development conference at DLIELC.

Utilized Rscripts to collect and analyze to data pertaining to attendance, usage and and feedback of sessions at the professional development conference for after action reports.

Managed technical aspects of delivering fully virtual conference with Zoom and YouTube LiveStream for professional development conference and Extremism Stand Down AF requirements.

Wrote and connected experimental files for dissertation research design, data collection, data analysis visualization and document creation utilizing Python, R and LaTeX.

Built my own data collection input device for my dissertation research project, which need sub millisecond accuracy utilizing university laser cnc machines, arcade buttons and arduino. I replicated a German University's design for electrical circuitry utilizing a raspberry PI to test and validate the accuracy of the box I built, which showed accuracy in the hundreds of microseconds.

I served as the Data Science Ambassador for the College of Humanities at the University of Arizona. I met with faculty, staff and graduate students to help them overcome hurdles related to data science, programming and visualization or to find resources available to them at the University (High performance computing, data storage, training) and/or open source solutions. I served as a Software Carpentries Instructor for Python and UNIX in 2020 at University of Arizona 2-day Workshop.

I volunteered with ResBaz Arizona, a local chapter of the international group ResBaz, where we provided five hours per week of open availability for anyone from the University or Tucson, AZ communities to come and chat about research, data science or to receive help on the projects in which they were working. We also held an annual conference of which I was an organizer in 2020 as well as the introductory Python instructor in 2020 and 2021. We helped people with accessing Virtual Machines, High Performance Computing, pipeline workflow programs and how to utilize containerization through Docker and Singularity. I was an instructor at an intensive two-week Cyber Carpentry workshop at University of North Carolina Chappel Hill where we covered these topics and the event culminated in project-based presentation of teams working to solve real world problems related to their fields of study at the graduate level.

I wrote macros in VBA and utilized R and Python to create dynamic reports that allowed the Department of Spanish of Portguese to efficiently create the 26 required syllabi, including semester calendars, each semester. Wrote scripts that allowed integration of the Learning Management System and instructor/coordinator enrollements to be completed automatically off of roster datasheets rather than manually updated within each individual LMS course site.
